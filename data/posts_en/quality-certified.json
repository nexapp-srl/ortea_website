  "body": "The belief that product quality and Customer satisfaction are the core of a modern organization, led to the implementation of a certified Company Managing System.\r\n\nA modern Company that wants to accept the challenge of today’s business scenario cannot do so without conforming to standardized organizational criteria.\r\n\nCustomer satisfaction, product quality and responsible occupational practices are the basis on which the Company’s activities can be consolidated. ORTEA SpA understood this a long time ago: the first ISO 9001 approval dates back to 1996.\r\n\nToday ORTEA SpA Integrated Managing System is approved by Lloyd’s Register according to the main Standards:\r\n\n* ISO9001 (Quality management systems).\r\n* ISO14001 (Environmental management systems).\r\n* OHSAS18001 (Occupational health & safety management systems).\r\n\nThis means that ORTEA SpA can ensure that its performance is optimized in terms of internal process management, commitment towards environmental issues and attention to health & safety at work within the frame of a single Managing System."
