  "body": "The supply of 16 80kvar 400V MINImatic HP20 power factor correction devices, with IP55 carpentry, is complete: 1280kvar supplied in total.\r\n\nThe equipment was manufactured with robust capacitors made of high-gradient metallized polypropylene (nominal voltage: 460V) and is characterised by a particularly robust carpentry with a high degree of protection.\r\n\nThe equipment is destined for a large European port and was, therefore, manufactured with IP55-degree protection carpentry.\r\n\nThis big piece of infrastructure has significant installed power, which is often, however, distributed across very wide areas: reducing the currents in play is essential, both for the efficiency of the plant and for environmental sustainability.\r\n\nIn this sense, capillary power factor correction is always an excellent choice."
