  "body": "This supply includes 6 power factor correction systems MULTImatic FH20 of 460kvar each at 400V, for a total of 2760kvar. \r\n\nThe plant is a large building used as an advanced logistics platform, one of the largest in northeastern Italy (almost 200,000 m2 covered, of which 140,000 m2 for robotic storage, 65 loading bays). \r\n\nThe installed power is huge: 8MW, a value that makes you think more of an industry than a logistics site!\r\n\nThe loads include new generation lighting, inverter air conditioners, electronic equipment, robotic handling systems: heavily distorting loads, which make it necessary to use heavy duty power factor correction systems with detuning chokes, such as the MULTImatic FH20, which are characterized by a tuning frequency of 180Hz, thanks to the generous sizing of its detuning reactors. \r\n\nPower quality is essential for guaranteeing absolute continuity of service to this kind of plants. And this is not easy to obtain: the huge total length of the cables and the consequent voltage drops, the sensitivity of many users, the current distortion... issues that must be kept under control. A detuned power factor correction system helps to avoid the risk of resonances, which could cause an amplification of the #harmonics, with a significant deterioration of the power quality. \r\n\nAnd all with an eye on energy efficiency: the whole plant is certified \"BREEAM Very Good\" ... also thanks to the ICAR power factor correction system."
