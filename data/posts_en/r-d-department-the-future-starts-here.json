The aim of Ortea Next engineers is to create innovative, increasingly high-performance solutions.\n\nThe R&D departmentâ€™s focus is currently on two projects:\n\n* the first involves the technological renewal of the Ortea Next Oxygen solutions range (sag compensators), with the aim of reducing the size of the equipment by using new-generation IGBT equipped with SiC technology;\n* the second relates to the creation of a new solution for eliminating the annoying phenomenon of micro-interruptions. The design specifications involve an intervention with a maximum duration of one second, which is activated in less than 10ms if the voltage sag exceeds 10%. The technology used involves IGBT and Ultracap.\n\nStay tuned to discover many other projects on their way!"
