  "body": "The italian Minister for Ecological Transition, Dr. Cingolani, stated that \"the electricity bill increased by 20% during the last quarter, we are expecting a further 40% increase for the next quarter.\"\r\n\nThe cause can be summarized in the increase of raw material prices and CO2 emission costs paid by energy companies and energy-intensive companies. This is happening not only in Italy, the scenario is the same all over the world.\r\n\nOur Power Quality solutions, in particular [Power Factor Correction Systems](https://icar.ortea.com/en/automatic-power-factor-correction/) and [Energy Efficiency Smart Devices](https://www.enersolve.it/en/energy-savings/) guarantee immediate savings.\r\n\nOrtea is at your disposal to guide you in the right choice."
