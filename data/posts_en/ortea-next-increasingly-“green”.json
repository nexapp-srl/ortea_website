The 140 panels are able to generate up to 200kW of power, with the excess power returned to the smart grid.\r\n\nThe project has been completed with the installation of charging stations in the internal car park and the replacement of the entire corporate vehicle fleet with electric and hybrid plug-in cars.\r\n\nBut, in terms of Power Quality, what problems does the installation of a solar power plant generate?\r\n\nWe know - do you?\r\n\nContact us now to find out the solution!"
