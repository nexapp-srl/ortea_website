  "body": "Big currents (max input current 5774A) involve the production of extra-large components: big bars, big transformers, big regulators... ultimately: big voltage stabilizers.\r\n\nLike these two 3200kVA SIRIUS with ± 20% input voltage range, intended to improve the power quality of a large Nigerian bank.\r\n\n\r\n\nThese are some numbers:\r\n\nPower rating: 3200kVA\\\nInput voltage: 400V ± 20%\\\nOutput voltage: 400V ± 0.5%\\\nRated current: 4619A\\\nMax input current: 5774A\\\nDimensions: 6200x2000x2400 mm\\\nWeight: 12.600 kg\r\n\n\r\n\nThe SIRIUS, ORTEA’s top-of-the-range model, is available from 60kVA up to 6000kVA and with different input voltage ranges: ±10%, ±15%, ±20%, ±25%, ±30%, +15/-35% and +15/-45%.\r\n\nThe control and stabilisation, performed on the true RMS value, are carried out by a two-way DSP-microprocessor under the supervision of a second \"bodyguard\" microprocessor, operating with a software specifically developed for ORTEA.\r\n\nThe columnar variable autotransformer with rollers (ORTEA design - without brushes, which are subject to heavy wear & tear) is solid and very reliable.\r\n\nThe user interface is a multilingual 10” touch panel equipped with RS485 port. The display shows all the electric parameters (voltage, current, active power etc.), the information regarding the operating modes (power on; voltage regulation limits; increase/decrease of voltage regulation etc.) and the alarms (minimum and maximum voltage, maximum current, overtemperature, etc.)."
