  "body": "One of our clients located in Bangladesh encountered serious power quality problems with the installed loads. The problems were caused by the voltage instability, but also by the phase inversion that occurred upon restart following the frequent blackouts to which it is subject.\r\n\nCurrently being assembled, the voltage stabilizer proposed by Ortea Next is a 1000kVA Sirius model with ±30% regulation. In collaboration with our primary circuit breaker supplier, the engineers of the planning department brilliantly resolved the phase inversion issue, adding two additional circuit breakers to the standard by-pass kit that, communicating with each other, make it possible to supply the load with a phase sequence that is always correct.\r\n\nTo obtain maximum satisfaction from our customers, Ortea Next is able to provide customized solutions for every requirement.\r\n\nThe Sirius range of the highest-performance and most complete voltage stabilizers in our production, is encountering a lot of success on the market.\r\n\nSirius is available for powers ranging from 60 to 6000kVA, with ±10%, ±15%, ±20%, ±25%, ±30%, +15/-35%, and +15/-45% adjustment. The control logic is managed by two DSP microprocessors (one that implements the control and the other that manages the measurements) that stabilize the output voltage, adjusting the true-RMS (root mean square) thereof. The whole system is supervised by a third (bodyguard) microprocessor that checks the correct operation of the other microprocessors.\r\n\nIn addition to the generous size and additional protections, which make the equipment very reliable and durable, the user interface is undoubtedly another very important feature.\r\n\nConsisting of a 10-inch, multilingual touch display (equipped with an RS485 port), it can provide information on the state of the lines upstream and downstream of the voltage stabilizer (voltage, current, power factor, active power, apparent power, reactive power, etc.), the operating state of the stabilizer (it displays all the information relating to each operating mode: on/off, adjustment limit reached, increase/decrease in adjustment, etc.), and any alarms (minimum and maximum voltage, maximum current, excessive temperature, etc.).\r\n\nIf connected to a network via Ethernet with an RJ45 cable, the display can, in addition, be remotely transmitted to a PC using VNC software. It is, in addition, possible to interface with the stabilizer using the Modbus TCP/IP protocol (a standard protocol in communicating between industrial electronic devices). The system is also equipped with two USB ports that can be used to download the data stored and upload software updates from the control card.\r\n\nThe interface possibilities widen with Ortea Cloud, the new Ortea platform for remotely monitoring voltage stabilizers."
