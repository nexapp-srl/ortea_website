  "body": "ORTEA is finalizing the manufacturing of the first batch of isolation transformers for a large Data Center project for the Ministry of Interior of a North African Country.\r\n\nThe transformers are equipped with a measurement control unit with RS485 communication module and Modbus protocol for remote monitoring with BMS system. They will be coupled with the already installed UPS.\r\n\nThe supply includes a total of 30 isolation transformers, 4 of which of 1250kVA and 2 of 1600kVA.\r\n\nA second batch will follow to complete the supply. \r\n\n\rThe installed control unit allows the customer to remotely monitor the operation of the transformer, including measurement and control functions. \r\n\n![](/images/uploads/centralina800px.jpg)\n\n\rThese transformers are highly customized, as a matter of fact their design is linked to the design of the UPS to which they must be coupled. A close cooperation with the customer is therefore an essential requirement for the development of the most suitable solution.\r\n\nThanks to decades of experience, ORTEA is able to design and manufacture transformers for any kind of UPS. The partnership with major manufacturers worldwide provides evidence of the high degree of reliability achieved."
