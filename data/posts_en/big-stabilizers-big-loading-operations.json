  "body": "When dealing with \"big\" stabilizers, such as these two 3200kVA SIRIUS, also their dimensions and weights are \"big\": each box measures 6500x2160x2770mm and weighs 14.600kg. As a consequence, also the loading operations require the use of extra-large cranes.\r\r\n\nSince we are talking about numbers, here are those relating to these two 3200kVA SIRIUS with ± 20% input voltage range:\r\n\n•\tPower rating: 3200kVA\r\\\n•\tInput voltage: 400V ± 20%\r\\\n•\tOutput voltage: 400V ± 0.5%\r\\\n•\tRated current: 4619A\r\\\n•\tMax input current: 5774A\r\\\n•\tDimensions: 6200x2000x2400 mm\r\\\n•\tWeight: 12.600 kg\r\n\nOur top-of-the-range model SIRIUS is available from 60kVA up to 6000kVA and with different input voltage ranges: ±10%, ±15%, ±20%, ±25%, ±30%, +15/-35% and +15/-45%.\r\n\nThe stabilization, performed on the true RMS value, is carried out by a two-way DSP-microprocessor under the supervision of a second \"bodyguard\" microprocessor, operating with a software which has been developed specifically for ORTEA.\r\n\nThe columnar variable autotransformer with rollers (ORTEA design - without sliding contacts, which are subject to heavy wear & tear) is solid and very reliable.\r\n\nThe user interface is a multilingual 10” touch panel equipped with RS485 port. The display shows all the electric parameters (voltage, current, active power etc.), the information regarding the operating modes (power on; voltage regulation limits; increase/decrease of voltage regulation etc.) and the alarms (minimum and maximum voltage, maximum current, overtemperature, etc.)."
